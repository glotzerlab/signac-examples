# signac - Tutorial and Examples

## Tutorial Notebooks

The [notebooks directory](notebooks/) contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as a tutorial.
They demonstrate how to implement a basic computational workflow using the [signac framework](https://signac.io).
The framework assists users in managing simple to complext data spaces for example by simplifying provenance tracking and meta data management.

Use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to view a [static version](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/glotzerlab/signac-examples/blob/master/notebooks/index.ipynb) of these notebooks.
Or start a [dynamic version](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glotzerlab/signac-examples/master?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb) with the service offered by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

To run the notebooks locally, clone the repository and then start Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-examples.git
cd signac-examples/notebooks
jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook
# Open `index.ipynb` in your Jupyter session
```

Note that some notebooks have dependencies beyond Jupyter, signac, and signac-flow, like the HOOMD-blue simulation tutorial. A full conda environment containing these dependencies can be installed with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --name signac-examples
```

## Example Projects

The [projects directory](projects/) contains a collection of project examples.
They are designed as examples and for the fast setup of new projects.

Simply clone or download this repository and copy all scripts into your signac project path, *e.g.*:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-examples.git
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
signac init MyProject
cp -r ../signac-examples/projects/flow.minimal/* ./
```

For more information, please see [projects/README.md](projects/README.md).
